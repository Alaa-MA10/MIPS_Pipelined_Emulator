# MIPS Pipelined Emulator

develop an emulator for MIPS pipelined CPU which can show the values of internal CPU components cycle by cycle for any
given machine code. Your emulator will only support the following MIPS instructions: **and, or, add, sub, beq**

The user should be able to input the machine code of a MIPS program (using the supported instructions only) and specify
its starting address by setting the PC register value. CPU registers are initialized as specified in Task 1. The
emulator should display any memory word used by the MIPS program.
